/*
 * fibheap.h: Implementation of Fibonacci heaps, which are data structures
 *            supporting a set of operations that constitutes what are known as
 *            "mergeable heaps", most of which run in const. amortized time.
 *
 *            D'apr√®s [1]: "A _Fibonacci heap_ is a collection of rooted trees
 *            that are _min-heap ordered_. That is, each tree obeys the _min-
 *            heap property_: the key of a node is greater than or equal to the
 *            key of its parent."
 *
 *            The complexity of programming Fibonacci heaps is what makes their
 *            study compelling mainly from the theoretical perspective. The
 *            interested reader is encouraged to check [1], pg. 506, under
 *            "Fibonacci heaps in theory and practice" for a relevant
 *            discussion.
 *
 * Summary of operations for Fibonacci heaps:
 *
 *  - make_fibheap()            Allocs. a heap.
 *  - make_fibheap_node()       Allocs. a heap node.
 *  - fibheap_is_empty()        Asserts if the heap is empty.
 *  - fibheap_insert()          Inserts a node into the heap's root list.
 *  - fibheap_minimum()         Peeks at the top of the heap.
 *  - fibheap_extract_min()     Detaches the min. node, then consolidates the heap.
 *  - fibheap_union()           Concatenates the root lists of two heaps.
 *  - fibheap_decrease()        Moves the decreased node to the heap's root list.
 *  - fibheap_delete()          Deletes a node, then consolidates the heap.
